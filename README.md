My first project in HTML&CSS Web.
The site was built in an authentic way, in design and using simple tools to simulate an internet site

## Home Screen

At the top of each page there is a navigation menu on the site.
At the bottom of each page there is a contact menu through membership networks and location information
The home page is built from consumer responses, links to a variety of promotions available on the site.
